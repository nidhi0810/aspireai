- `query: "Data Scientist"` + `location: "Remote"`
- `query: "Product Manager"` + `location: "New York, NY"`

### Common Issues:

**1. "Job search failed" error:**

- Check your API usage limits

**2. No results returned:**
- Try broader search terms
- Check if location is spelled correctly
- Remove filters and try again

**3. Rate limit exceeded:**
